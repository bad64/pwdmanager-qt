		<p>
			In the "File" menu, you can find two functions meant for manipulating the database as a single object, rather than a collection of credentials.
			<br>
			<br>
			The "Export" function will save the database as a .crdb file at a place of your choosing. You can then move the database to a different computer, back it up to the cloud like
			an ordinary file, and so forth.
			<br>
			<br>
			The "Import" function will allow you to import either a previously exported database file (usually with a .crdb extension), or a backup (usually with a .crdb.bak extension).
			However, you can also use it to import a database from older versions of the software (< 2.1.0, usually with either a .db or .db.bak extension), at which point the software
			will automatically convert it to the new binary file format.
