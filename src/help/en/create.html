		<p>
			To create a new set of credentials, press the "New Entry" button. You will be asked to fill the following fields, although you can choose to leave any of them blank:
			<ul>
				<li>Username: The username for the credentials pair you are about to create. Can be an e-mail address, a screen name, etc...</li>
				<li>Purpose: What you will use the credentials for, i.e. a website, or application.</li>
				<li>Password: The password for the credentials pair you are about to create.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			Although you can input a password of your own creation, you can also use the integrated password generation facility if you desire.<br>
			The password generator uses the following mutators:
			<ul>
				<li>Length: Specifies the desired length of the generated password, in number of characters.</li>
				<li>Uppercase characters: Instructs the generator to include uppercase letters.</li>
				<li>Numeric characters: Instructs the generator to include numbers.</li>
				<li>Special characters: Instructs the generator to include non-alphanumeric characters.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			Once the fields are filled to your liking, press the "Validate" button to write a new entry to your database.
