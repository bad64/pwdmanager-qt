			The search box exhibits two behaviors, determined by whether or not the "Exact match" check box is ticked (You can toggle it by pressing Alt+X):
			<ul>
				<li>Unticked: This is the default behavior. The search box will attempt to find any entry matching your input, regardless of the field.
				It will, for example, match the expression "mail" with both "mail", "Hotmail", and "Mailman".</li>
				<li>Ticked: The search box will attempt to find an exact match in any field of any row. For example, it will <strong>NOT</strong> match the expression "mail" with either "Hotmail" or "Mailman".
				It will only match with "mail", without prefix or suffix.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Please note that the search box is not case-sensitive in either case.
