			Should you be in need of modifying a previous entry, you can perform either of the following actions:
			<ul>
				<li>Double clicking on the cell you wish to edit</li>
				<li>Highlight the cell you wish to edit, then press the "Edit" button</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			A dialog box will pop up, prompting you to enter new information. If the field you wish to edit is the password field, you will also be presented with a password generation box, identical in function
			to the one you were presented with during the initial credentials creation. Please refer to the <a href="create.html">Create a New Entry</a> page for further information about password generation.
			<br>
			<br>
			The "Delete" button will, predictably, erase the entire row from the database.
