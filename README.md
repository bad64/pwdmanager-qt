# Password Manager, now with Qt !

A large(ish) rework of my console-only multiplatform password manager that you can find on this GitHub (right [here](https://github.com/bad64/pwdmanager)).

Made with Qt 5.10. Currently untested on Linux. It has a couple more functions than its console counterpart, like editing database rows, or cross-platform copy to clipboard !
