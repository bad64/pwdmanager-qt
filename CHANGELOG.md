**CODE CHANGES**

- All: Removed all the C-style code (for real this time), replaced by equivalent C++ code (this actually saves around 200kb of RAM usage)

**FEATURES**

- All: Merged import & convert functions (having both separated was redundant)
- All: Removed Edit menu after getting feedback that no one used it (to be fair, neither did I)
- All: New Help menu that looks really retro
